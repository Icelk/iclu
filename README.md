> icelk command line utilities (or icelk core light utilities) are a collection of small CLIs I've built to make the terminal life easier.

Iclu are a set of command line utilities to fill in the gaps of the command line. I regularly use all of these to simplify common tasks.


# Features

If you want another feature (or binary), open an issue and I'll make it if it sounds like a good idea.

You can of course also write the *Rust* code and open a PR.
